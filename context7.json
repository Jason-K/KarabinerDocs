    "Karabiner-Elements uses JSON configuration files stored at ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json",
    "Complex modifications use manipulators with 'from' and 'to' event definitions",
    "The 'from' event defines what input to capture (key_code, consumer_key_code, pointing_button, or any)",
    "The 'to' event defines what output to generate (can include key events, shell commands, mouse control, etc.)",
    "Conditions control when manipulators activate (application, device, variable, input source based)",
    "Use 'to_if_alone' for dual-purpose keys (e.g., Caps Lock as Escape when tapped, Control when held)",
    "Use 'to_if_held_down' for actions that trigger when a key is held",
    "Use 'to_delayed_action' for time-based logic and multi-tap detection",
    "Variables enable state management between key presses for complex multi-step shortcuts",
    "Manipulators are evaluated top to bottom - first match wins",
    "Use 'lazy': true when creating dual-purpose modifier keys to prevent immediate modifier sending",
    "Parameters control timing: to_if_alone_timeout_milliseconds, to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds",
    "Always escape dots in bundle identifiers for application conditions: com\\.apple\\.Terminal",
    "The 'halt' property stops further event processing in specific contexts",
    "Use EventViewer to find key codes, bundle identifiers, and debug configurations"
