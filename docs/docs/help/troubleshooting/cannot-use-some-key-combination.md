# Cannot use some three key combinations (key event is not fired)

It’s a hardware limitation of your keyboard called “two-key rollover” if you cannot use some three key combinations.
(e.g.,physical left command key + right command key + m)

` physical left command key + right command key + m ` There are two way to avoid the rollover problem.

- Use another keyboard which is N-key rollover.
- Use other key combinations.
